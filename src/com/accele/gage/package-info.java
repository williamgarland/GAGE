/**
 * Contains the core components of the General Abstracted Game Engine.
 * 
 * <p>
 * GAGE (or the General Abstracted Game Engine) is an engine developed for use with the LWJGL API. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use,
 * and fully scalable. Most operations concerning the engine itself are done through the main {@link com.accele.gage.GAGE GAGE} class.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that for macOS implementations, the JVM must be started with the {@code -XstartOnFirstThread} argument in order for GLFW, the windowing API used by LWJGL, to work.
